Change cases
============
	With the progress of information technology and genetics, there are some potential problems we may need to consider, they are divided into two aspects for us to talk about in following:

Information technology aspects
------------------------------
	The develop of information technology is swift and enormous, but no matter how it changes, the basic technology is fixed, what we need to pay attention to is growing genetic databases. So it's critical for us to optimize our databaes of gene expression and make the response time of browser shorter.


Genetics aspects
----------------
	The future genetics' progress is uncertain, but it's certain that our understanding of genes is just a drop in the ocean,thus, in the future, the gene may be a gigantic information base, so we must maintain and sort out the current gene databases.
